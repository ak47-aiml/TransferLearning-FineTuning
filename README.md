# TransferLearning-FineTuning

Use pre-defined model with the help of Keras.Application module. Introduce an example of using Keras Functional API

Use the same EfficientNetB0 model, the allows to classify images, however here replace the input layer and add our own input layer for the images we have

Following is included here:

  Load & Prepare training and test images
  Use Functional API to build layers for the model
  Train & Evaluate model
  Explore model performance
